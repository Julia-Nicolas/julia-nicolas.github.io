I'm Julia Nicolas, a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at [CREST - ENSAE](https://crest.science/) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). 

My [research](/research/) focuses on healthcare access inequalities in France, with a particular emphasis on disparities associated with migratory background. I am especially interested in how institutional arrangements and social stratification shape unequal access to healthcare services. My work primarily relies on quantitative methods and survey data. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I obtained an engineering degree from [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/), with a specialization in Data Science for Social Science. I also completed a Research Master’s degree in Quantitative Sociology and Demography at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/).

Since January 2026, I have been a visiting student at [Nuffield College, University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/).

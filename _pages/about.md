I'm Julia Nicolas, Ph.D. candidate in Sociology at [CREST - ENSAE](https://crest.science/) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). 

My [research](/research/) focuses on healthcare access inequalities in France, with a particular emphasis on disparities associated with migratory background. I am especially interested in how institutional arrangements and social stratification shape unequal access to healthcare services. My work primarily relies on quantitative methods and survey data.

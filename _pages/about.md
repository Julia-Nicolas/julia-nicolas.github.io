I'm Julia Nicolas, 3rd-year PhD student in Sociology at [CREST - ENSAE](https://crest.science/) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris), under the supervision of Patrick Präg, Sorana Toma and Paola Tubaro. 

My [research](/research/) focuses on healthcare access inequalities in France, with a particular emphasis on disparities associated with migratory background. I am especially interested in how institutional arrangements and social stratification shape differences in the use of medical and preventive healthcare services. My work primarily relies on quantitative methods and French survey data for the moment.

Before starting my Ph.D., I obtained an engineering degree from [ENSAE Paris](https://www.ensae.fr/), with a specialization in Data Science for Social Science. I also completed a Research Master’s degree in Quantitative Sociology and Demography at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/).

Since January 2026, I have been a visiting student at [Nuffield College, University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/).

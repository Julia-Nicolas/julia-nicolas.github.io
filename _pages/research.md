## Research interests

My research focuses on inequalities in access to healthcare in France, with a particular emphasis on immigrant populations. In a first paper, I examined the impact of language barriers on access to different healthcare providers in France. In ongoing work, I adopt an intersectional perspective to study inequalities in access to preventive healthcare, relying primarily on quantitative methods.

## Research interests


My research focuses on inequalities in access to healthcare in France, with a particular emphasis on immigrant populations. My work examines several dimensions of healthcare access, including language barriers, intersectional inequalities, and the role of local healthcare environments and neighborhood-level service availability. I am particularly interested in patterns of healthcare use, such as access to specific medical providers and the uptake of preventive healthcare services. My research primarily relies on quantitative methods and survey data.

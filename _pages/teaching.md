Over the first two years of my PhD, I developed a strong interest in teaching. My teaching experience covers courses in sociology and quantitative methods.

## Lecturer

  Designed and taught in collaboration with a colleague, this introductory course introduced students to the core concepts, theoretical
  perspectives, and methodological tools of sociology, as well as to more applied sociological topics.
